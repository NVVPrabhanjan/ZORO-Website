            <p>
              Founded in 2015, Zoro began with a simple idea: create products that solve everyday problems in thoughtful ways. Our founder, Alex Johnson, started the company in a small garage with just three employees and a vision to revolutionize the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, we've grown from that small garage to an international company with offices in five countries. Throughout our journey, we've remained committed to our founding principles of innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Zoro is recognized as a leader in our field, with a dedication to pushing boundaries and creating products that make a real difference in people's lives.
